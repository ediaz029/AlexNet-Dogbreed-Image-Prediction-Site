# Dogbreed-Image-Prediction-Site
Individual class project which deploys a client-server implementation from Google Colab. User Interface accepts dog breed input for image classification/prediction using AlexNet CNN.

The implementation of the project consists of deploying a server on the local machine using the open-source framework Streamlit. The client aspect consists of deploying an app with a user-friendly interface utilizing ngrok, which exposes the local server to the internet and accepts image URLs for returning predictions. ![image](https://github.com/ediaz029/Dogbreed-Image-Prediction-Site/assets/112585936/4019d371-ed44-4878-963e-67c876718aaa)

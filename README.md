# Dogbreed-Image-Prediction-Site

Individual class project which deploys a client-server implementation from Google Colab. User Interface accepts dog breed input for image classification/prediction using AlexNet CNN.

The project's implementation involves deploying a server on the local machine using the open-source framework Streamlit. The client end consists of deploying an app with a user-friendly interface utilizing ngrok, which exposes the local server to the internet and accepts image URLs for returning predictions.
